# RabbitMQ Job Queue Demo
This codebase is for my tutorial *[RabbitMQ Job Queue With PHP](http://blog.programster.org/rabbitmq-job-queue-with-php/)*, and can be used to quickly get started with creating job queues in PHP.

To use the codebase, **you will need to perform a composer update**. I deliberately did not include the packages in my source code as I didn't want to worry about Licenses. All my work here is free to use under the MIT license, but the packages may or may not be.
